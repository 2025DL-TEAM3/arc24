# Iteration 1. Few-shot prompting

_16-07-2024_

## Goal

How far can we go using few-shot prompting? What is the best way to encode the grids for an LLM?

## Motivation

I want to do a quick iteration where I take an LLM (f.e. phi-3) and use few-shot prompting. I will give different solved problems as input and see how well the LLM do both on the validation and the test set.

## TODO

- [ ] What is the best way to encode the grids?
- [ ] Does using reasoning and description of the grids helps?
