# Iteration 1. Representation of Grids

_30-06-2024_

## Goal

Can we teach a model to learn a representation of the grids?

## Motivation

A good representation is crucial for abstraction. We need to teach the model
the priors needed to solve the ARC challenge

## Development

### Priors to learn

TODO: which are the priors we can learn from a single grid?
How objects are defined in the ARC challenge

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps

- Once the grid representation is learned, we need to teach the model to learn transformation between grids. Some priors are change-related and cannot be learned from a single grid

## TODO

- [ ] How to evaluate the representation of the models? Phi-3, Llama3, Gemma2
- [ ] Start with basic square world
- [ ] Curriculum learning might be helpful to do cause attribution
