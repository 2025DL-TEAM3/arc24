# Iteration 6. Ensemble with 2020 solution

_14-08-2024_

## Goal

There is a public notebook that scores 26 just using program search. If I can ensemble that with my
current LLM approach there is a good chance to achieve a higher score (hopefully the LLM and program search will be very orthogonal)

## Motivation

Using LLMs and test-time fine-tuning I'm currently scoring 5 on the leaderboard. However there is a [public
notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mehrankazeminia/3-arc24-developed-2020-winning-solutions) that scores 26 and runs in 3-4 hours.

There is a good opportunity to create an ensemble. And if I can improve the accuracy of the LLMs the accuracy
of the ensemble will also likely go up.
