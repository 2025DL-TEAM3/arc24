# Iteration 7. Training data

_15-08-2024_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Try different configurations of training data and see how the validation loss is affected.

## Motivation

## TODO

- [ ] What is the effect of changing the train data? Keep the same train configuration and just change the data.
    - [ ] How the test accuracy changes if I train in the eval set?
    - [ ] How the test accuracy changes if I train in both the train and eval set?
    - [ ] What if I use the train dataset and n-1 eval dataset?
    - [ ] What if I only do test-time fine-tuning?
    - [ ] Is it helpful to first train with re-arc?
    - [ ] Use other arc-like datasets for training
    - [ ] What is the effect of using more training data? Can I estimate how the loss will decrease if generating more tasks?
