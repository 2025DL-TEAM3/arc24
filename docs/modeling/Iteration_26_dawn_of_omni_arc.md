# Iteration 26. Dawn of Omni-ARC

_16-09-2024_

## Goal

- Create a new dataset with python code that solves the ARC training tasks.
- Create a set of primitive functions that are used to solve many tasks (DSL)
- Create new tasks inspired by the training tasks and using the primitive functions
- Learn more about the ARC tasks

## Motivation

To learn a good representation of the data I believe that I should take the Omni-ARC approach: learn
many tasks related to ARC. The most promising task would be to write code that implements the ARC tasks.
It will allow to verify if it runs on the training samples giving a great advantage over voting.

This is going to be a very experimental iteration, thus I have many goals because I'm not sure what
will be the optimal approach to do this.

## Development

- The code should be able to cope with data augmentation, and I should test that
- I'm going to create new modules to store the code. The library `inspect` is useful to retrieve the source code.

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps

## TODO

- [ ] Have a look at RE-ARC, maybe I can reuse it.
