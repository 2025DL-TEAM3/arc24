# Iteration 28. Optimal train duration and capacity

_22-09-2024_

## Goal

What is the optimal train duration and capacity to improve the validation score? And for the leaderboard score?

## Motivation

## Development

## Results

### Optimal train duration for full fine-tune

TODO:

### Does LoRA achieve better generalization?

TODO:

## Conclusion

## Next steps

## TODO

- [ ] Determine the optimal training steps for a full model fine-tune
- [ ] Do the same for different LoRAs
- [ ] Does the optimal training steps double when also learning to predict input from inputs?
- [ ] Do the results hold for the leaderboard? How to account for the extra training data?
