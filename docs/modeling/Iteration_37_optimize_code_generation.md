## TODO

- [ ] How does the training steps affect the accuracy? -> Run trainings with different training lenght, just using code data
- [ ] What is the best prompt? Is there any difference?
- [ ] Is it helpful to learn to do other tasks?
- [ ] Do the results improve if we do test-time fine-tuning?
- [ ] What if I train on omniarc just on the default task?
