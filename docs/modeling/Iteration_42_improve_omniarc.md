# Iteration 42. Improve Omni-ARC

_14-10-2024_

## Goal

The idea is to devote at least a week to improve Omni-ARC dataset. At the same time I will run
daily trainings with the updated versions of the dataset and measure progress on the evaluation dataset.

## Motivation

The initial version of Omni-ARC has around 150 training tasks. A model trained on that version is
able to solve just 5% of the evaluation dataset. There should be a lot of room for improvement:

- Add more tasks to increase coverage
- Add more training inputs to have more variability (can I reuse re-arc for this?)
- Add task variations
- Add task to learn to use the primitives
