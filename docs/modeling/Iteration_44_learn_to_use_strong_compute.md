# Iteration 44. Learn to use Strong Compute

_22-10-2024_

## Goal

Learn to use the Strong Compute cluster.

## Motivation

[Strong compute](https://strongcompute.com/) has graciously granted me with compute credits to speedup my development in the
last weeks of the challenge. That means I will have access to GPUs with 80GBs of memory and I could
train much faster than with the [Veridas](https://veridas.com/en/) cluster.

## Development

### Initial idea

- Since my datasets are small I believe I can work on the root folder.
- They have said that it only has sense to use GPUs in multiples of 8.
- H100 is [newer and faster than a100](https://gcore.com/blog/nvidia-h100-a100/)

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps

## TODO

- [ ] Create a python environment for the experiments
- [ ] Copy the data and code to the ISC (instant super computer)
- [ ] Train a submission model with strong compute
- [ ] How much faster can I train?
- [ ] Differences between A100 and H100
